A.All Basecamp Accounts:
1) Ensure that the to-do list in the TO-DO section in all basecamp accounts are assigned to the responsible person and with a set due date.
2) Follow-up with the responsible person for to-dos that are due. Change due date if advised to do so and inform the Internal Director of any urgent task being delayed.
